Abstract: Fake news can have extremely harmful effects on society, such as increasing polarization, instilling distrust in the media and government, inciting violence, and encouraging dangerous health practices (Fleming, n.d.). Psychologists believe that fake news is effective because it incites an emotional response that clouds people’s judgement. My hypothesis is that the frequency of emotion-related words may therefore be a way to detect fake news. To test my hypothesis, I trained a Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier on a dataset consisting 17,455 fake news articles and 21,192 true news articles converted into a bag-of-words representation, achieving a classification accuracy of 94%. Extracting the top features used for fake versus true classification and applying a sentiment analysis model to produce sentiment scores of the top 100 words associated with each class demonstrated that on average, words associated with fake news expressed 10x more negative sentiment than the words associated with true news. Overall, this model is effective at fake news detection, and the computational results of this study are in line with psychologists’ beliefs.
